When those changes do occur, they often select a secret that is similar to their old memorized secret by applying a set of common transformations such as increasing a number in the password. \\n>[Source](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-FAQ/#q-b05) (q-b05)\\n\\nAs a result, enforcing password expiries may actually bring more harm than improve security. Such tools like MFA can bring more benefits than using password expiries.\\n\\n\\nLogging into our Win 10 VM again, we will connect to the Domain\\n![4c66fe1de24d10792e1e3abea22960a3.png](../_resources/4c66fe1de24d10792e1e3abea22960a3.png)\\n<center>*Make sure that the Server VM is running, otherwise the domain won\'t be recognized.* Also note that the login (username) will be based on the user logon name you provided!</center>\\n\\n\\n\\n![6b0e9d45aa5af848636dff35f5326584.png](../_resources/6b0e9d45aa5af848636dff35f5326584.png)\\nNow, the VM will restart and you can sign on!
