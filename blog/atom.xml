        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="taking-a-look-back-at-the-opensea-phishing-attack">Taking a look back at the OpenSea Phishing Attack<a href="https://etam1234.github.io/Insights-N-Notes/blog/Phishing#taking-a-look-back-at-the-opensea-phishing-attack" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Taking a look back at the OpenSea Phishing Attack" title="Direct link to Taking a look back at the OpenSea Phishing Attack">​</a></h2>
<p>For those unaware of the incident, the OpenSea marketplace is by their own words the "largest NFT marketplace". As such OpenSea was the target of several phishing campaigns in the past 2 years.</p>
<p>These campaigns usually are easy to spot by their call to action (usually to fill something private or critical to your account)
<img loading="lazy" alt="opensea-phishing.png" src="https://etam1234.github.io/Insights-N-Notes/assets/images/opensea-phishing-665d79d579ad51fe456d9daf4024be95.png" width="642" height="957" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>In this case, the phishing email attempts to get the user to generate another api key (one that is fake), where instead the site where you input your key will be used to steal the user's NFT.</p>
<p>Note that the email also addresses the user simply as "message to Developers/OpeanSea API Users". Obviously an email that uses your actual name shouldn't always be trusted, but it should be another signal to be wary of an email if it does not use your username.</p>
<p>In general, whenever an email asks you to perform a security related operation like changing/updating sensitive information, you should always go directly to the official website to confirm any issues.</p>
<p>After being reminded of this Phishing campaign from about a year ago, with AI on the rise, I wanted to observe for myself the various ongoing phishing campaigns and, unfortunately there exists a significant amount, right on youtube.com, the fake "livestreams"</p>

<p>How do channels get hijacked in the first place? Generally the impersonators will hijack a youtube channel by getting an unsuspecting user to open a file as described here:</p>

<p><em>tl;dw is that they will send an email with an enticing offer and unbeknownst to the youtuber, the email is attached with malicious code to hijack their channel when run.</em></p>

<p>The goal of these CS2 "Livestreams" is to try to steal your Steam user data, by filling out a form you presume will be to login to Steam, but it's not.</p>
<p>While the first category of examples im about to share do not employ AI, they do use impersonation. These channels will impersonate official esport players/organizations to get users to click their stream:</p>

Notice the @ name has various symbols alongisde the name, and has only 1 video, the "livestream".</p>
<p>Once users click on a stream, they will be greeted by either a vod (video on demand) stream, that is, a "livestream" of a video that the impersonator downloaded.</p>
<p>Fortunately, for these "livestreams" (which are VODs), there is a huge tell that these are clearly pre-recorded videos that they download:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="not a livestream.png" src="https://etam1234.github.io/Insights-N-Notes/assets/images/not-a-livestream-f9a03df4134112ce538ca262ac445c95.png" width="1889" height="1107" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>See the highlighted section on the bottom left of the VOD <em>(QR code is intentionally blurred)</em>?
This is on every client on CS2 which tells you the date and some telemetry information for Valve devs. Notice that it's being recorded on Dec 11th (2023) when it's already April 2024!</p>
<p>As for the content of what they are offering, these impersonators claim to offer "free" skins by going to their website.</p>
<p>When you first enter the site, they have a "captcha" which is merely a veil to make the site seem more legit even though, it doesn't actually go through a captcha.</p>
<p>In addition, if you check the header,
the referrer policy is "unsafe-url" which by mozilla docs is can be used for malicious purposes.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="05d7f5deb8104d001c6524dba94465a8.png" src="https://etam1234.github.io/Insights-N-Notes/assets/images/05d7f5deb8104d001c6524dba94465a8-88d7b16ad1eb1d6800e8ad50bae33f8f.png" width="1139" height="299" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>If you try to check out their website, they've done some pretty clever things to try and fool players.</p>
<ol>
<li>They have a "captcha" which is just to make you feel like the site is "secure".</li>
<li>When you refresh the site does not change and remember's the skin you "won" (it also happens to be the same skin you win every time you enter the site w/ a new cookie)</li>
<li>You are prompted with what looks like a legit Steam logon form (more on that down below).

<em>Notice when you refresh the page, there's a single frame of the "case" before switching over to the skin you "won".</em></p>

<p>Some things to notice about the "form" itself</p>
<ol>
<li>The QR code does not work (because it's a temporary login code generated by Steam).</li>
<li>The address bar is suspiciously unnatural; see how in the link itself there's a small gap</li>
<li>There's snow "falling" behind this popup (from the css of the website), when it's supposed to be a popup. That should not happen.</li>
</ol>
<p>Still, if you didn't know what to look for, you could definitely get fooled by this, it's very impressive.</p>

<p>Remember when I described mentioned esport orgs being impersonated? With those, they copy the stream's vods. In this case, the impersonation is clearer because of the checkmark and a more obvious comparison:</p>

Notice the @ does not match up, is not a verified channel, and the name and about page suggests this is a hijiacked channel.</p>
<p>You can see here with this channel that there's even another video from the youtuber warning others about how their channel got hacked.
They do not detail how exactly it happened, but I presume likely they opened a file without knowing it was malicious.</p>

<p>Now what about the crypto related scams? These ones aren't quite phishing campaigns but I thought it was worth sharing nonetheless. Similar to the CS2 "livestream channels", these ones target the crypto audience.</p>
<p>As you can see here, in this case, the channel hijacked WAS a verified youtuber (denoted by their checkmark) which makes it hard to spot differences (from the official channel its impersonating), but as you'll notice, the channel itself is not quite the same as the channel name as the videos it showcases below the livestream, a small difference you wouldn't notice on a first glance</p>

<p>What's really interesting is that in the "livestream" itself, it loops 2 videos. One video is the normal actual podcast that takes place, and the second video is AI generated, based off of the vod and then modified to make it sounds realistic enough. The scary part is it's quite believable, save for some small portions.</p>
<p>Here's a short clip showing what i mean:</p>
<iframe height="400px" width="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iQzbwCpxaqw"></iframe>
<p>Again, even though it's still fairly obvious with the poor lip syncing (presumably done thru editing and not AI), the audio portion is still good enough that some would be tricked into thinking that this was actually the person speaking about the "drop".</p>
<p>If you compare AI with what it was 2 years ago, it'd look night and day. Honestly, it's pretty scary how accurate AI is becoming.</p>

<p>While we have a general idea how channels get hijacked, I  dug a bit further to see what these specific youtubers (being hijacked in the clips I shared here) are saying about the situation.</p>
<p>Rather than solely contacting via email, these phishing campaigns are now also using twitter as another means of sending malware. Though I havent personally tried it yet, I think it may be fun to see if twitter does scan for malware to an extent.</p>

<p>Although I am not sure if the malware itself has persistence, its definitely very scary that it's a possibility.</p>
<p>X (formerly known as twitter) is undoubtedly a gold mine for anyone looking to start phishing campaigns. Since anyone can "purchase" a verified checkmark, people will likely associate that with a degree of security, when it is not the case.
I only expect phishing campaigns to rise (on Twitter) for this reason <!-- -->😨</p>

<p>Obviously this is only the current chapter (as of April) for these phishing attacks on YouTube as they will constantly hop from trend to trend (earlier when LinusTechTips was hacked, his channel was converted to a Tesla channel), to avoid YouTube's detection system.</p>
<p>Will there be an end to these issues? Honestly I doubt it. With AI, phishing techniques will only become even more advanced and believable. AI will only continue to advance, and so will the phishing awareness campaigns needed to combat these issues.</p>
<p>Still, I hope this blog was informative! <!-- -->😄</p>]]></content>

<p>Next, I configured the network on VirtualBox, in order to create a simulated network between the AD VM with the other Win 10 VMs.
<img loading="lazy" alt="f7a4b7b0c843619cadbebd1cc0b338a3.png" src="https://etam1234.github.io/Insights-N-Notes/assets/images/f7a4b7b0c843619cadbebd1cc0b338a3-5a26be6a7210b1f7a6bf8c08fc5078d7.png" width="1248" height="717" class="img_ev3q"></p>

Next, when we launch our Win 10 machines again and proceed with setup, we can "Domain Join Instead" and proceed with setup as normally.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="a41996da3fd38be5045fbbc8e2713d8b.png" src="https://etam1234.github.io/Insights-N-Notes/assets/images/a41996da3fd38be5045fbbc8e2713d8b-c7b68f1cb00102372f1f6fa6be63a2bd.png" width="1024" height="755" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>I then configured the network for the Win 10 VM with the Server, by getting the IP address of my Server:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="6057bb65a07af99f8a791ad9cb67b251.png" src="https://etam1234.github.io/Insights-N-Notes/assets/images/6057bb65a07af99f8a791ad9cb67b251-3781f713c190938de764b614549bfa92.png" width="1023" height="539" class="img_ev3q"></p>

Here, we can choose the features to add within the server.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="dc144395abb2d9c2b6fa6b7929a109b4.png" src="https://etam1234.github.io/Insights-N-Notes/assets/images/dc144395abb2d9c2b6fa6b7929a109b4-6977bb1f6155ed0764d153eda61771c2.png" width="976" height="694" class="img_ev3q">
I let the process complete so that Acive Directory would be installed. (The server will restart)</p>
<p>In the below screenshots, I then created a user:
<img loading="lazy" alt="cfa6fa3d0fad6a8d214e5a0ded8f7470.png" src="https://etam1234.github.io/Insights-N-Notes/assets/images/cfa6fa3d0fad6a8d214e5a0ded8f7470-d4f89e69bb4a3b6d0abb62d42efe0863.png" width="1018" height="622" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="3fe0b66b2341e96f0efdcb84cd9f5d96.png" src="https://etam1234.github.io/Insights-N-Notes/assets/images/3fe0b66b2341e96f0efdcb84cd9f5d96-c1e7904758f8720e0c1ce373c1120600.png" width="1015" height="709" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>In this environment, I set the password to never expire, though you can opt for different settings.</p>
<p>When it comes to password expiries, NIST notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Users tend to choose weaker memorized secrets when they know that they will have to change them in the near future. When those changes do occur, they often select a secret that is similar to their old memorized secret by applying a set of common transformations such as increasing a number in the password.
<a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-FAQ/#q-b05" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Source</a> (q-b05)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a result, enforcing password expiries may actually bring more harm than improve security. Such tools like MFA can bring more benefits than using password expiries.</p>
<p>Logging into our Win 10 VM again, we will connect to the Domain
<img loading="lazy" alt="4c66fe1de24d10792e1e3abea22960a3.png" src="https://etam1234.github.io/Insights-N-Notes/assets/images/4c66fe1de24d10792e1e3abea22960a3-a12f868a25de5755bb53c7d74f27e153.png" width="1920" height="646" class="img_ev3q">
</p><center><em>Make sure that the Server VM is running, otherwise the domain won't be recognized.</em> Also note that the login (username) will be based on the user logon name you provided!</center><p></p>
<p><img loading="lazy" alt="6b0e9d45aa5af848636dff35f5326584.png" src="https://etam1234.github.io/Insights-N-Notes/assets/images/6b0e9d45aa5af848636dff35f5326584-a450c9bf36124425e20159b1ce19076a.png" width="829" height="510" class="img_ev3q">
Now, the VM will restart and you can sign on! (on the other user)</p>
<p>At this point, I will play around with the settings to understand some of the tools provided by Windows Server.</p>

<p>Thanks for taking the time to check out the website!</p>
<p>This blog will likely contain anything I find interesting, although I will most likely orient my focus on Cybersecurity or InfoSecs related concepts. I don't know currently what I'll write about just yet, but I am considering possibly doing a bi-weekly roundup of cybersecurity news/resources if that is useful.</p>
<p>Some ideas I have are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Biweekly roundup of noteworthy cybersecurity news (as well as my overall thoughts)</li>
<li>Doing writeups of CTFs or any deep dives I do</li>
<li>Writing about miscellaneous topics (unlikely but a possibility)</li>
<li>Potentially writing about changes I'll be making to the website.</li>
</ul>
