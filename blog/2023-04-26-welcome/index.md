## Hi! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for taking the time to check out the website!

This blog will likely contain anything I find interesting, although I will most likely orient my focus on Cybersecurity or InfoSecs related concepts. I don't know currently what I'll write about just yet, but I am considering possibly doing a bi-weekly roundup of cybersecurity news/resources if that is useful. 

Some ideas I have are:
- Biweekly roundup of noteworthy cybersecurity news (as well as my overall thoughts)
- Doing writeups of CTFs or any deep dives I do 
- Writing about miscellaneous topics (unlikely but a possibility)
- Potentially writing about changes I'll be making to the website.

:::note
I do plan to do blog updates about the overall webpage to point out more of the noteworthy changes I made.
