# To-Do List 💡

:::note 
This is a list of immediate additions/changes I am looking to make. <br /> In addition, completed tasks will eventually be removed after a certain period of time, and added to the [legacy list instead](03-LEGACYtodolist.md)
:::

- [X] Add first 7 days of TryHackMe
    - [ ] And proofread them [**In Progress**]
- [ ] Finish adding all my notes on TryHackMe's Advent of Cyber (also add link here) [**In Progress**]
    - [X] Add Day 8
    - [X] Add Days 9-14
    - [ ] Add Remaining days (Days 16-24)
- [ ] Organize resources tab, including file naming (prioritize within folders)
- [ ] Add Cyber Risk notes?
- [ ] Add Advent of Cyber 2022 (after days are finished)
- [ ] Start adding posts on blog (currently using template placeholders)
- [ ] Even more Proofread (Permanent in this to-do list 😅)
- [ ] Add any more ideas that i should add.
- [ ] Start working on Hackthebox (maybe also academy?)

## General Ideas 📐

A list of ideas worth potentially adding listed here!
:::

- [X] Add legacy to-do list of things ive completed? (and add ~~date~~ month it was completed too perhaps)
- [ ] Make blog more generic content?
- [ ] Start leveraging GIFs for some assets to demonstrate certain parts of the lab?
- [ ] For tryhackme advents (specifically 2022), make it more clear when the lab section starts
