### OSINT Process Cycle
Each individual and team will have a methodology in their approach.

### Shadow IT
>Public Cloud is an easy way for business units to engage in shadow IT. And the most accessible public cloud to get started with is AWS.

Bucket quite clearly out for everyone to see

`http://images.bestfestivalcompany.com.s3.amazonaws.com/` - with this link above, we can just see the entire bucket's contents, very insecure.

*Learned that the keys usually start with ASIA or AKIA*

### Useful techniques:

A few other common AWS reconnaissance techniques are:

   - Finding the Account ID belonging to an access key:
   		- 	`aws sts get-access-key-info --access-key-id AKIAEXAMPLE` 
  -  Determining the Username the access key you're using belongs to
		-  `aws sts get-caller-identity --profile PROFILENAME`
    - Listing all the EC2 instances running in an account
    aws ec2 describe-instances --output text --profile PROFILENAME
 -    Listing all the EC2 instances running in an account in a different region
    aws ec2 describe-instances --output text --region us-east-1 --profile PROFILENAME

Esssentially we gotta invote the --profile command otherwise it wont know what we are checking for.

Through the command - `aws secretsmanager list-secrets --region us-east-1 --profile apple`  (note apple was the profile I made using `configure`)
