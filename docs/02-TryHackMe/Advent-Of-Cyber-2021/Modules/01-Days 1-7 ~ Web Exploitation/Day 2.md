When an HTTP request is crafted, the method and target header will always be included. The target header will specify what to retrieve from the server, and the method header will specify how.

It's common to use get to retrieve info (like loading a picture) and post to send info like (login info) to a server.

Status 200 lets you know it went through successfully.

Here we can see the request is successful 

### Cookies
Cookies are designed to help the server communicate with the client. 
In TryHackMe, we will look at authentication cookies (session cookies)

Most of these components are handled by the server, so the main and interesting values are "Name" and "Value." Cookies are prepared in pairs. In our case we use Name and Value. 

```Set-Cookie: <cookie-name>=<cookie-value>; Domain=<domain-value>; Secure; HttpOnly```

In the developer tools, we can manipulate cookie values. Some cookies may be encoded, but may also be decoded to understand the cookies. 

1. Obtain a cookie value from registering or signing up for an account.
2. Decode the cookie value.
3. Identify the object notation or structure of the cookie.
4. Change the parameters inside the object to a different parameter with a higher privilege level, such as admin or administrator.
5. Re-encode the cookie and insert the cookie into the value space; this can be done by double-clicking the value box.
6. Action the cookie; this can be done by refreshing the page or logging in.

Here when we submit a register form, we can see a cookie made.

We notice that we can decode as ASCII Hex

When we change username = admin and change our session cookie as such, we finally login, bypassing the need to be a "valid" admin
