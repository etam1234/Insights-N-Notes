>The development team that handles gift requests from Children migrated over to a new technology stack. In doing so, they left their application vulnerable, and Grinch Enterprises now controls access to the system. Fortunately, Grinch enterprises forgot to patch the system so you can use the same vulnerability to retrieve the gift requests for the students.

Ignore selection of the username we put `weewoo` (to return any other member) and also specify the role to be `guest`
