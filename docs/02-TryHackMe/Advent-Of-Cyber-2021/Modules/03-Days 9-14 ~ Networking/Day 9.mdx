## [Day 10] <Highlight color="#FFD580">Networking</Highlight> Where Is All This Data Going

>McSkidy recently found out that a large amount of traffic is entering one system on the network. Use your traffic analysis skills to determine what kind of activities Grinch Enterprises are performing.

Here, we start by performing a simple packet analysis with **wireshark**. This is a technique to intercept and analyze network traffic. 

>Packet analysis may also be called with different terms such as packet sniffer, packet analyzer, protocol analyzer, or network analyzer.

Tools like wireshark provide more readability for packets and has many useful features to allow for one to detect a threat.

The filter section lets you filter the packets for a specific target of your choosing. 
For example, `ip.addr == 172.21.2.116` will search for any ip addresses of this specific destination or source. 

*Some more examples:* <br />
`http contains google.com` means we are looking for any that have the domain of google.
Filter by port: `tcp.port : tcp.port == 3389` (we can use the bool operator, `not` , to filter out that specific port too).

### HTTP #1 - GET
Now, lets look at Http traffic. To filter the request method, we can do `http.request.method == GET` for only `GET` requests.
We can see here for example there are gets for /admin or /login.

### HTTP #1 - POST
Now lets check POSTs next, *which are usually used for login forms*. Oh hey what's that? A login detail?

Btw, if we rightclick, we can follow the TCP stream like so

Also note the user-agent and the password/username

### DNS (Domain Name System)
The DNS is what takes a url and changes it to an IP. That's why ppl dont have to remember IPs. The example here we will use this domain: `packet.tryhackme.com`
 and `udp.port == 53` or DNS (mean the same thing for querying). 

>By expanding the Domain Name System (query) subtree, it is obvious that this packet is a question Questions: 1, where the client queries a domain name and looks for an answer from the server. Also, by checking the Queries subtree, we can see that the client is asking for a type A record of the packet.tryhackme.com domain name.

(Mostly just follow the guide to come to the conclusions)
