> McDatabaseAdmin came rushing into the room and cried to McSkidy, “We’ve been locked out of the reindeer schedule - how will Santa’s transportation work for Christmas?” The grinch has locked McDatabaseAdmin of his system. You need to probe the external surface of the server to see if you get him his access back.

If a service is blocking ping probes from NMap, try `-Pn` to see if it will scan.

We can see that the MS SQL server is indeed running.  
`sqsh -S 10.10.97.31 -U sa -P t7uLKzddQzVjVFJp` is the full command where, after `-S` is the server, `-U` is the username and `-P` is the password to try and see if our login works.

It's worked:

Here, we are selecting info on the databases which reveals the contents of the table

:::note Next Steps
You have done fantastic work! You have helped McDatabaseAdmin retrieve the schedule! Now, let’s see if we can run MS Windows commands while interacting with the database. Some MS SQL Servers have xp_cmdshell enabled. If this is the case, we might have access to something similar to a command prompt.

A good start, but we need to dig deeper to find flag. Once, we do, we will find an interesting file in the `grinch` user's home dir.

Finally, we look inside the file and its contents![dirFlag.png](/img/_resources/Days_9-14/Day_11/dirFlag.png)
