>Grinch Enterprises has been leaving traces of how their hackers have been accessing data from the system - you’ve found a unique server they use. We need your help to find out what method they’ve been using to extract any data.
>
>We have noticed that IP ADDRESS is generating unusual traffic. We highly suspect that Grinch Enterprises are using it to access our data. We will use Nmap to discover the services are running on their server.
>
>In the scan results you received earlier, you should be able to spot NFS or mountd, depending on whether you used the -sV option with Nmap or not. Which port is detected by Nmap as NFS or using the mountd service?

Had signifcant issues with this day in particular and largely followed the [video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BQqjJwFLLII), by Neal Bridges, to complete this day. I have included this page, however, for posterity sake (in the event I choose to come back to this and review it again).
