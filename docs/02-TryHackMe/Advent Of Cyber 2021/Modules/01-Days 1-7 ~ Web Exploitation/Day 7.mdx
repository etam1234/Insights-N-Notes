## [Day 7] <Highlight color="#621d27">Web Exploitation</Highlight> Migration Without Security 

>The development team that handles gift requests from Children migrated over to a new technology stack. In doing so, they left their application vulnerable, and Grinch Enterprises now controls access to the system. Fortunately, Grinch enterprises forgot to patch the system so you can use the same vulnerability to retrieve the gift requests for the students.

mongo to enter the database and start doing mongo commands...
 show databases:
![showingdb.png](/img/_resources/Day_7/showdb.png)
 
![modifyingdb.png](/img/_resources/Day_7/modifydb.png)
Here they are creating a new db and adding new formats to it.

Seeing the value in the flagdb database.

![nosqlinjection.png](/img/_resources/Day_7/nosqlinjection.png)<br />
Here we apply the nosql injection. It tells us it's sucessful and so we can check the website for real
 
![loggedin.png](/img/_resources/Day_7/loggedin.png)<br />
**See now, we are logged in!** <br />
 
![moreinjection.png](/img/_resources/Day_7/moreinjection.png)
Ignore selection of the username we put `weewoo` (to return any other member) and also specify the role to be `guest`
 
![evenmoreinjection.png](/img/_resources/Day_7/evenmoreinjection.png)
In this statement, we are trying to return every row in the table to look for one that has the entry `McSkidy` and the role can be whatever so we use `[$ne]`
