From googling the author (OWoodflint), we can find this [user](https://twitter.com/OWoodflint): (which could potentially be removed due to [new twitter terms](https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/inactive-twitter-accounts) with 30 day inactivity)

We are provided the BSSID address: B4:5D:50:AA:86:41. From here, I searched for potential tools to use, there's also a bas64 encoded hint suggesting we use [Wigle](https://www.wigle.net/).

On advanced search, we get get more fine info. For example the SSID is: UnileverWiFi
